# Resume Builder

This is a resume builder app built with React.  Users can enter general information, education details, and work experience.
  
This is the [CV Application Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-cv-application) from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Javascript Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript).  The purpose of this project was to gain experience working with React state and props.
